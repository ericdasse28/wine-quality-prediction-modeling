# Wine Quality Prediction Modeling

Implementation of a model that predicts the quality of a red wine on a scale of 0-10 given a set of physicochemical features of wine as inputs
Dataset : [Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

## Data and model versioning

We use DVC to version data and the ML model. The remote repository used for data and model
is [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/ericdasse28/wine-quality-prediction-modeling/src/main)
